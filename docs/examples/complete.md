# Complete Example

This is a comprehensive Agentic Automation Canvas example with all sections populated, demonstrating advanced features and real-world usage patterns.

## Overview

The complete example includes:

- **Full Project Definition**: Title, description, objectives, stages, domain, keywords, funding, and benefit metrics
- **User Expectations**: Multiple requirements with detailed benefit metrics and per-task stakeholders
- **Developer Feasibility**: TRL levels, technical risk assessment, model selection, baseline capabilities, expected gains, implementation difficulty
- **Governance**: Multiple governance stages with agents (people, organizations, software), milestones, and compliance standards
- **Data Access**: Dataset metadata with access rights, sensitivity levels, DUO terms, and PIDs
- **Outcomes**: Deliverables, publications with DOIs, and evaluation results with metrics

## Structure

This example populates all major sections: project definition (with rough estimate and primary value driver), user expectations (requirements with per-task stakeholders and multiple benefit types), developer feasibility (TRL, risk, model selection, implementation difficulty), governance (stages with agents, milestones, compliance), data access (datasets with DUO terms and sensitivity levels), and outcomes (deliverables, publications, evaluations).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major sections populated
- **Real-world Patterns**: Demonstrates typical usage scenarios
- **Standards Compliant**: Follows the RO-Crate specification and all referenced ontologies
- **Validated**: Passes schema validation
